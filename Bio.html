								<h1>About Me</h1>

							<p>My name is Scott Merchant. I am a senior at The University of Alabama planning to graduate in December of 2022 with a degree in Mathematical Statistics and a minor in Computing Technology & Applications. While at Alabama, I established and grew my passion for Engineering, Math, and Computer Science. My main field of study was math and statistics, where I focused on probability, statistical modeling, and analysis. My minor allowed me to enhance my Excel skills and introduced me to database technologies and SQL. I also learned object-oriented programming and picked up a few programming languages.<br><br>
								Outside of my academic studies, I was a part of the drumline in the Million Dollar Band for 4 years from 2017-2020. We helped provide every gameday with an exciting atmosphere for tens of thousands of fans. We were made up of 400 students and learned 5 shows every season. We traveled to many cities across the country and performed at huge venues such as the 2017 BOA Nationals, Walt-Disney World, and multiple post-season football games including 2 National Championships. I was also a part of the University Symphonic Band and University Percussion Ensemble from 2017-2018.<br><br>
								In 2019, I had the opportunity to intern at Bolzoni-Auramo in Sulligent, AL as an engineering intern. During this internship, I worked with other interns on a variety of projects related to product assembly lines. These projects include the implementation of Manufacturing Execution System (MES) quality control software, data analysis and visualization, and 3D modeling of parts to be used in other projects. We provided maintenance for assembly lines and developed new processes to ensure manufacturing went as smoothly as possible with the best quality. I was able to provide managers with analysis from the MES software we implemented to help track down the root cause of defective parts, and this lowered the number of defective products that got shipped out. During this internship, the projects I had that required analysis of production data led me to find my enjoyment for data science. By far the most enjoyable thing was seeing solutions work because of my own work.<br><br>
